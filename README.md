# Digital-Butler
Digital Butler is an app that will aid providers with answering customer problems such as
connection and home network issues. We mainly worked on the front end design of the product,
a web app, that will be used for professional purposes (providers). The application will be able to
show information/history of oneâ€™s home network and efficiently resolve connectivity issues.
